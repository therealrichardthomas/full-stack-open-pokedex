The language I've picked is Java. In Java, some ways that Java users can lint, test and build their programs are Checkstyle, a code formatting tool; JUnit, a unit testing framework; and Maven, XML-based configuration for building. Some other options that I found are popular to use apart from Jenkins and GitHub Actions are Azure DevOps and AWS CodePipeline. Azure DevOps have both options for self-hosting and cloud-based through there Azure DevOps Services (cloud platform) and Azure DevOps Server (self-hosted server). Which one is better? It depends on your applications use case for it. If your team are doing something simple and require speed, then the cloud-based service is your best bet since it requires zero maintenance. But if your team requires something complex or deep acess, then a self-hosted server is your choice since you can configure your data among other things. Some things to consider when making your choice of the service you want:
1. Are there any Data & Compliance Constraints? Does data need to be in a specific location?
2. What is your maintenance capacity? Do you have a dedicated devops team?
3. Do you need special customizations over your data? 
4. Where are your users located? Is your team spread our globally or in one building?
